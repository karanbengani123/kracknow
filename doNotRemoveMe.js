/**
 * CAUTION!!
 * Do not remove this file.
 * This is just a dummy file to suppress webpack errors when compiling sequelize.
 * By default sequelize loads all drivers using require. there is no way for webpack to identify which lib to
 * omit from loading. thus, we are referring the unwanted modules to doNotRemoveMe.js file in the webpack config.
